# Marian Antiphons
This repository contains settings of Marian antiphons, both individually 
and as a booklet for use in singing them throughout the liturgical year.

I am indebted to the [Gregorio](http://gregorio-project.github.io/index.html)
LaTeX package, without which this would have been much more difficult.

To compile the files into PDF, you will need to use `lualatex`. The latest
version will always be available under Releases.
